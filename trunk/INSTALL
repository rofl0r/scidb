                       How To Compile

==============================================================================
UNIX
==============================================================================
A normal unix installation is made in three or four steps (after you've
unpacked the source archive):

   ./configure
   make
   make check-build
   make install

Note: if the step with "make check-build" fails, please re-configure and build
again:

   CXXFLAGS="-Wall -DBROKEN_LINKER_HACK=1" ./configure
   make clean
   make
   make install

This "broken linker hack" is required on many modern Linux/Unix distributions
because the newer version of GNU linker is broken.

You probably need to be root when doing the last command. An alternative is to
use the "sudo" command for the installation:

   sudo make install

Get a full listing of all available configure options by invoking it like:

   ./configure --help

If you want to install scidb in a different file hierarchy than /usr/local,
you need to specify that already when running configure:

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/scidb/tree

If you happen to have write permission in that directory, you can do "make
install" without being root. An example of this would be to make a local
install in your own home directory:

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME
   make
   make check-build
   make install

The configure script always tries to find a working Tcl/Tk library unless
explicitly told not to. If you have Tcl/Tk installed in the default search
path for your compiler/linker, you don't need to do anything special. If
you have Tcl/Tk somewhere else (for example, /opt/mytcltk), you can run
configure like:

   PATH=$PATH:/opt/mytcltk/bin \
   ./configure --tcl-includes=/opt/mytcltk/include \
               --tk-includes=/opt/mytcltk/include \
               --tcl-libraries=/opt/mytcltk/lib \
               --tk-libraries=/opt/mytcltk/lib

Note that the PATH variable has to contain the path of the Tcl shell (for
example '/opt/mytcltk/bin' which contains tclsh8.5), otherwise the Tcl shell
will not be found.
