                       How To Compile

==============================================================================
UNIX
==============================================================================
Probably you have to install some required packages:

1. Tcl/Tk package

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install tcl8.6
      > sudo apt-get install tk8.6

2. Freetype development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev

3. SM library development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libsm-dev

4. Xcursor development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev

5. fontconfig development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev

A normal unix installation is made in three or three steps (after you've
unpacked the source archive):

   ./configure
   make
   make install

You probably need to be root when doing the last command. An alternative is to
use the "sudo" command for the installation:

   sudo make install

Get a full listing of all available configure options by invoking it like:

   ./configure --help

If you want to install scidb in a different file hierarchy than /usr/local,
you need to specify that already when running configure:

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/scidb/tree

If you happen to have write permission in that directory, you can do "make
install" without being root. An example of this would be to make a local
install in your own home directory:

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME
   make
   make install

The configure script always tries to find a working Tcl/Tk library unless
explicitly told not to. If you have Tcl/Tk installed in the default search
path for your compiler/linker, you don't need to do anything special. If
you have Tcl/Tk somewhere else (for example, /opt/mytcltk), you can run
configure like:

   PATH=$PATH:/opt/mytcltk/bin \
   ./configure --tcl-includes=/opt/mytcltk/include \
               --tk-includes=/opt/mytcltk/include \
               --tcl-libraries=/opt/mytcltk/lib \
               --tk-libraries=/opt/mytcltk/lib

Note that the PATH variable has to contain the path of the Tcl shell (for
example '/opt/mytcltk/bin' which contains tclsh8.5), otherwise the Tcl shell
will not be found.
