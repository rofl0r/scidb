                       How To Compile

==============================================================================
UNIX
==============================================================================
Probably you have to install some required packages:

1. Tcl/Tk package

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install tcl8.6
      > sudo apt-get install tk8.6

2. Freetype development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev

3. SM library development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libsm-dev

4. Xcursor development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev

5. fontconfig development package
   (normally available, but especially missing under Ubuntu)

   On Debian/Ubuntu use:
      > sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev

A normal unix installation is made in three steps (after you've unpacked
the source archive):

   ./configure
   make
   make install

You probably need to be root when doing the last command. An alternative is
to use the "sudo" command for the installation:

   sudo make install

Get a full listing of all available configure options by invoking it like:

   ./configure --help

If you want to install scidb in a different file hierarchy than /usr/local,
you need to specify that already when running configure:

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/scidb/tree

If you happen to have write permission in that directory, you can do "make
install" without being root. An example of this would be to make a local
install in your own home directory:

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME
   make
   make install

The configure script always tries to find a working Tcl/Tk library unless
explicitly told not to. If you have Tcl/Tk installed in the default search
path for your compiler/linker, you don't need to do anything special. If
you have Tcl/Tk somewhere else (for example, $HOME/mytcltk), you can run
configure like:

   PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mytcltk/bin \
   ./configure --tcl-includes$HOME=$HOME/mytcltk/include \
               --tk-includes=$HOME/include \
               --tcl-libraries=$HOME/mytcltk/lib \
               --tk-libraries=$HOME/mytcltk/lib

Note that the PATH variable has to contain the path of the Tcl shell (for
example '$HOME/mytcltk/bin' which contains tclsh8.5), otherwise the Tcl shell
will not be found.

Not every GCC compiler version is properly working. The minimum compiler
version is 3.4, and version 4.6 is excluded because of a compiler bug. It may
be required to install a proper compiler. For example you decided to version
4.4: on Debian/Ubuntu use

   sudo apt-get install gcc-4.4
   sudo apt-get install g++-4.4
   ./configure --gcc-version=4.4

Alternatively the clang compiler may be used. The minimal clang version which
can be used is 3.1. The newer version 3.3 is also working, but it's not yet sure
that this version is linking properly. If you want to use clang tell it to the
configure script in this way:

   ./configure --gcc-version=clang

On Debian/Ubuntu system the usage of newer compilers is a bit problematic,
because Debian has changed some system paths. It may be required to tell
the configure script the required paths, for example:

   ./configure \
      --gcc-version=4.7 \
      SYS_CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu" \
      SYS_CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu" \
      SYS_LDFLAGS="-B/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu"

Exchange "i386-linux-gnu" with the system specific part of your architecture.
It's of course a bad idea from Debian that the user has to know the system
paths, but the configure script may give you a hint. If you invoke this script
(./configure) look at the output, it shows a line like this:

   Location of X11 library: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu

The latter part of the path (in this example "i386-linux-gnu") is your system
specific part.
