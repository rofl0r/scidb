This is not the original tkhtml library. This version is modified
by Gregor Cramer for use in Scidb.

Some enhancements:

	Double buffering implemented. You have to define USE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING=1
	during compile time.

new commands:

	<pathname> charset
		Returns the charset given in HTML object "meta", e.g.:
		"<meta http-equiv="content-type"  content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>"
		will give "utf-8". The result may be empty if no charset is given or
		if the charset couldn't be recognized.

	<nodeHandle> dynamic get flag
		Returns the status of the argument "flag" in given node.

new options:

	-doublebuffer
		Specifies whether double buffering should be used.

	-cursor
		Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the widget.

	-exportselection
		Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget should also be the X selection.
		Selection is possible only if this option is enabled.
	
	-selectbackground
	-selectforeground
	-inactiveselectbackground
	-inactiveselectforeground
		Specifies the colors for selection.

is supporting more attributes:

	<ol start="12">...</ol>

and has a new dynamic flag:

	<node> set dynamic user
