This is not the original tkhtml library. This version is modified
by Gregor Cramer for use in Scidb.

Some enhancements:

	Double buffering implemented. You have to define USE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING=1
	during compile time.

	Support for table attribute 'fixed-layout' implemented.

	Support for zero width ligatures.

	Some fixes in line breaking algorithm (the layout algorithm is still a mess).

	Fixes in layout algorithms of <sub> and <sup>.

new commands:

	<pathname> charset
		Returns the charset given in HTML object "meta", e.g.:
		"<meta http-equiv="content-type"  content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>"
		will give "utf-8". The result may be empty if no charset is given or
		if the charset couldn't be recognized.
	
	<pathname> viewbox
		Returns the current view box.

	<nodeHandle> dynamic get flag
		Returns the status of the argument "flag" in given node.

new options:

	-class <classname>

		Specifies the class name of this widget.

	-doublebuffer <flag>
		Specifies whether double buffering should be used.
		Default is 0.

	-cursor <cursor>
		Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the widget.

	-exportselection <flag>
		Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget should also be the
		X selection.  Selection is possible only if this option is enabled.
		Default is 0.
	
	-selectbackground <color>
	-selectforeground <color>
	-inactiveselectbackground <color>
	-inactiveselectforeground <color>
		Specifies the colors for selection.

	-showhyphens <flag>
		flag=0: discard soft hyphens (&shy;)
		flag=1: use soft hyphens for hyphenation
		flag=2: show all soft hyphens (for proof-reading)
		Default is 0.
	
	-latinligatures <flag>
		Specifies whether latin ligatures should be used.
		Default is 0.
		HTML example for ligature ff: "f&zwj;f" or "f&#x200D;f".
		Unluckely in most fonts the ligatures are ugly.
	
	-fixedwidth <dimension>
		Set the width of the internal canvas to a fixed with, otherwise a
		configuration of the widget width would re-layout the content. Set
		this option to zero if a re-layout is required.

is supporting more attributes:

	<ol start="12">...</ol>

and has more dynamic flags:

	<node> set dynamic user
	<node> set dynamic user1	# alias for flag user
	<node> set dynamic user2
	<node> set dynamic user3
