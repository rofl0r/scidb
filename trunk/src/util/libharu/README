The original distribution is available at <libharu.org>.

This is not the original distribution. I've mixed in a derivation,
found at <https://github.com/kdeforche/libharu/tree/>. The UTF-8
support of the original distribution is a mess, this derivation has
a working UTF-8 support.

Furthermore I've changed the footprint of a few functions, and added an
important function: HPDF_LoadFont(). This function is loading a font
given by the family name.
