INDEX
	_fclose_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fclose(FILE *<[fp]>);
	int _fclose_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fclose(<[fp]>)
	FILE *<[fp]>;

	int fclose(<[fp]>)
        struct _reent *<[reent]>
	FILE *<[fp]>;

DESCRIPTION
If the file or stream identified by <[fp]> is open, <<fclose>> closes
it, after first ensuring that any pending data is written (by calling
<<fflush(<[fp]>)>>).

The alternate function <<_fclose_r>> is a reentrant version.
The extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

RETURNS
<<fclose>> returns <<0>> if successful (including when <[fp]> is
<<NULL>> or not an open file); otherwise, it returns <<EOF>>.

PORTABILITY
<<fclose>> is required by ANSI C.

Required OS subroutines: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>, <<lseek>>,
<<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

FUNCTION
<<fflush>>---flush buffered file output

INDEX
	fflush
INDEX
	_fflush_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fflush(FILE *<[fp]>);

	int _fflush_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

DESCRIPTION
The <<stdio>> output functions can buffer output before delivering it
to the host system, in order to minimize the overhead of system calls.

Use <<fflush>> to deliver any such pending output (for the file
or stream identified by <[fp]>) to the host system.

If <[fp]> is <<NULL>>, <<fflush>> delivers pending output from all
open files.

Additionally, if <[fp]> is a seekable input stream visiting a file
descriptor, set the position of the file descriptor to match next
unread byte, useful for obeying POSIX semantics when ending a process
without consuming all input from the stream.

The alternate function <<_fflush_r>> is a reentrant version, where the
extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure, and
<[fp]> must not be NULL.

RETURNS
<<fflush>> returns <<0>> unless it encounters a write error; in that
situation, it returns <<EOF>>.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fflush>>.  The behavior on input streams is only
specified by POSIX, and not all implementations follow POSIX rules.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.

<<fgetc>> that is passed the additional reentrant structure
pointer argument: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
The next character (read as an <<unsigned char>>, and cast to
<<int>>), unless there is no more data, or the host system reports a
read error; in either of these situations, <<fgetc>> returns <<EOF>>.

You can distinguish the two situations that cause an <<EOF>> result by
using the <<ferror>> and <<feof>> functions.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fgetc>>.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

FUNCTION
<<fmemopen>>---open a stream around a fixed-length string

INDEX
	fmemopen

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	FILE *fmemopen(void *restrict <[buf]>, size_t <[size]>,
		       const char *restrict <[mode]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<fmemopen>> creates a seekable <<FILE>> stream that wraps a
fixed-length buffer of <[size]> bytes starting at <[buf]>.  The stream
is opened with <[mode]> treated as in <<fopen>>, where append mode
starts writing at the first NUL byte.  If <[buf]> is NULL, then
<[size]> bytes are automatically provided as if by <<malloc>>, with
the initial size of 0, and <[mode]> must contain <<+>> so that data
can be read after it is written.

The stream maintains a current position, which moves according to
bytes read or written, and which can be one past the end of the array.
The stream also maintains a current file size, which is never greater
than <[size]>.  If <[mode]> starts with <<r>>, the position starts at
<<0>>, and file size starts at <[size]> if <[buf]> was provided.  If
<[mode]> starts with <<w>>, the position and file size start at <<0>>,
and if <[buf]> was provided, the first byte is set to NUL.  If
<[mode]> starts with <<a>>, the position and file size start at the
location of the first NUL byte, or else <[size]> if <[buf]> was
provided.

When reading, NUL bytes have no significance, and reads cannot exceed
the current file size.  When writing, the file size can increase up to
<[size]> as needed, and NUL bytes may be embedded in the stream (see
<<open_memstream>> for an alternative that automatically enlarges the
buffer).  When the stream is flushed or closed after a write that
changed the file size, a NUL byte is written at the current position
if there is still room; if the stream is not also open for reading, a
NUL byte is additionally written at the last byte of <[buf]> when the
stream has exceeded <[size]>, so that a write-only <[buf]> is always
NUL-terminated when the stream is flushed or closed (and the initial
<[size]> should take this into account).  It is not possible to seek
outside the bounds of <[size]>.  A NUL byte written during a flush is
restored to its previous value when seeking elsewhere in the string.

RETURNS
The return value is an open FILE pointer on success.  On error,
<<NULL>> is returned, and <<errno>> will be set to EINVAL if <[size]>
is zero or <[mode]> is invalid, ENOMEM if <[buf]> was NULL and memory
could not be allocated, or EMFILE if too many streams are already
open.

PORTABILITY
This function is being added to POSIX 200x, but is not in POSIX 2001.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<sbrk>>.

FUNCTION
<<fopen>>---open a file

INDEX
	fopen
INDEX
	_fopen_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	FILE *fopen(const char *<[file]>, const char *<[mode]>);

	FILE *_fopen_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>,
                       const char *<[file]>, const char *<[mode]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	FILE *fopen(<[file]>, <[mode]>)
	char *<[file]>;
	char *<[mode]>;

	FILE *_fopen_r(<[reent]>, <[file]>, <[mode]>)
	struct _reent *<[reent]>;
	char *<[file]>;
	char *<[mode]>;

DESCRIPTION
<<fopen>> initializes the data structures needed to read or write a
file.  Specify the file's name as the string at <[file]>, and the kind
of access you need to the file with the string at <[mode]>.

The alternate function <<_fopen_r>> is a reentrant version.
The extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

Three fundamental kinds of access are available: read, write, and append.
<<*<[mode]>>> must begin with one of the three characters `<<r>>',
`<<w>>', or `<<a>>', to select one of these:

o+
o r
Open the file for reading; the operation will fail if the file does
not exist, or if the host system does not permit you to read it.

o w
Open the file for writing @emph{from the beginning} of the file:
effectively, this always creates a new file.  If the file whose name you
specified already existed, its old contents are discarded.

o a
Open the file for appending data, that is writing from the end of
file.  When you open a file this way, all data always goes to the
current end of file; you cannot change this using <<fseek>>.
o-

Some host systems distinguish between ``binary'' and ``text'' files.
Such systems may perform data transformations on data written to, or
read from, files opened as ``text''.
If your system is one of these, then you can append a `<<b>>' to any
of the three modes above, to specify that you are opening the file as
a binary file (the default is to open the file as a text file).

`<<rb>>', then, means ``read binary''; `<<wb>>', ``write binary''; and
`<<ab>>', ``append binary''.

To make C programs more portable, the `<<b>>' is accepted on all
systems, whether or not it makes a difference.

Finally, you might need to both read and write from the same file.
You can also append a `<<+>>' to any of the three modes, to permit
this.  (If you want to append both `<<b>>' and `<<+>>', you can do it
in either order: for example, <<"rb+">> means the same thing as
<<"r+b">> when used as a mode string.)

Use <<"r+">> (or <<"rb+">>) to permit reading and writing anywhere in
an existing file, without discarding any data; <<"w+">> (or <<"wb+">>)
to create a new file (or begin by discarding all data from an old one)
that permits reading and writing anywhere in it; and <<"a+">> (or
<<"ab+">>) to permit reading anywhere in an existing file, but writing
only at the end.

RETURNS
<<fopen>> returns a file pointer which you can use for other file
operations, unless the file you requested could not be opened; in that
situation, the result is <<NULL>>.  If the reason for failure was an
invalid string at <[mode]>, <<errno>> is set to <<EINVAL>>.

PORTABILITY
<<fopen>> is required by ANSI C.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<open>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

FUNCTION
<<fopencookie>>---open a stream with custom callbacks

INDEX
	fopencookie

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	FILE *fopencookie(const void *<[cookie]>, const char *<[mode]>,
			  cookie_io_functions_t <[functions]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<fopencookie>> creates a <<FILE>> stream where I/O is performed using
custom callbacks.  The callbacks are registered via the structure:

	typedef ssize_t (*cookie_read_function_t)(void *_cookie, char *_buf,
						  size_t _n);
	typedef ssize_t (*cookie_write_function_t)(void *_cookie,
						   const char *_buf, size_t _n);
	typedef int (*cookie_seek_function_t)(void *_cookie, off_t *_off,
					      int _whence);
	typedef int (*cookie_close_function_t)(void *_cookie);

.	typedef struct
.	{
.		cookie_read_function_t	*read;
.		cookie_write_function_t *write;
.		cookie_seek_function_t	*seek;
.		cookie_close_function_t *close;
.	} cookie_io_functions_t;

The stream is opened with <[mode]> treated as in <<fopen>>.  The
callbacks <[functions.read]> and <[functions.write]> may only be NULL
when <[mode]> does not require them.

<[functions.read]> should return -1 on failure, or else the number of
bytes read (0 on EOF).  It is similar to <<read>>, except that
<[cookie]> will be passed as the first argument.

<[functions.write]> should return -1 on failure, or else the number of
bytes written.  It is similar to <<write>>, except that <[cookie]>
will be passed as the first argument.

<[functions.seek]> should return -1 on failure, and 0 on success, with
*<[_off]> set to the current file position.  It is a cross between
<<lseek>> and <<fseek>>, with the <[_whence]> argument interpreted in
the same manner.  A NULL <[functions.seek]> makes the stream behave
similarly to a pipe in relation to stdio functions that require
positioning.

<[functions.close]> should return -1 on failure, or 0 on success.  It
is similar to <<close>>, except that <[cookie]> will be passed as the
first argument.  A NULL <[functions.close]> merely flushes all data
then lets <<fclose>> succeed.  A failed close will still invalidate
the stream.

Read and write I/O functions are allowed to change the underlying
buffer on fully buffered or line buffered streams by calling
<<setvbuf>>.  They are also not required to completely fill or empty
the buffer.  They are not, however, allowed to change streams from
unbuffered to buffered or to change the state of the line buffering
flag.  They must also be prepared to have read or write calls occur on
buffers other than the one most recently specified.

RETURNS
The return value is an open FILE pointer on success.  On error,
<<NULL>> is returned, and <<errno>> will be set to EINVAL if a
function pointer is missing or <[mode]> is invalid, ENOMEM if the
stream cannot be created, or EMFILE if too many streams are already
open.

PORTABILITY
This function is a newlib extension, copying the prototype from Linux.
It is not portable.  See also the <<funopen>> interface from BSD.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<sbrk>>.

FUNCTION
<<fgetc>>---get a character from a file or stream

INDEX
	fgetc
INDEX
	_fgetc_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fgetc(FILE *<[fp]>);

	#include <stdio.h>
	int _fgetc_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fgetc(<[fp]>)
	FILE *<[fp]>;

	#include <stdio.h>
	int _fgetc_r(<[ptr]>, <[fp]>)
	struct _reent *<[ptr]>;
	FILE *<[fp]>;

DESCRIPTION
Use <<fgetc>> to get the next single character from the file or stream
identified by <[fp]>.  As a side effect, <<fgetc>> advances the file's
current position indicator.

For a macro version of this function, see <<getc>>.

The function <<_fgetc_r>> is simply a reentrant version of
<<fgetc>> that is passed the additional reentrant structure
pointer argument: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
The next character (read as an <<unsigned char>>, and cast to
<<int>>), unless there is no more data, or the host system reports a
read error; in either of these situations, <<fgetc>> returns <<EOF>>.

You can distinguish the two situations that cause an <<EOF>> result by
using the <<ferror>> and <<feof>> functions.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fgetc>>.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

ANSI_SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
	Reads at most <[n-1]> characters from <[fp]> until a newline
	is found. The characters including to the newline are stored
	in <[buf]>. The buffer is terminated with a 0.

	The <<_fgets_r>> function is simply the reentrant version of
	<<fgets>> and is passed an additional reentrancy structure
	pointer: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
	<<fgets>> returns the buffer passed to it, with the data
	filled in. If end of file occurs with some data already
	accumulated, the data is returned with no other indication. If
	no data are read, NULL is returned instead.

PORTABILITY
	<<fgets>> should replace all uses of <<gets>>. Note however
	that <<fgets>> returns all of the data, while <<gets>> removes
	the trailing newline (with no indication that it has done so.)

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,

DESCRIPTION
<<fputc>> converts the argument <[ch]> from an <<int>> to an
<<unsigned char>>, then writes it to the file or stream identified by
<[fp]>.

If the file was opened with append mode (or if the stream cannot
support positioning), then the new character goes at the end of the
file or stream.  Otherwise, the new character is written at the
current value of the position indicator, and the position indicator
oadvances by one.

For a macro version of this function, see <<putc>>.

The <<_fputc_r>> function is simply a reentrant version of <<fputc>>
that takes an additional reentrant structure argument: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
If successful, <<fputc>> returns its argument <[ch]>.  If an error
intervenes, the result is <<EOF>>.  You can use `<<ferror(<[fp]>)>>' to
query for errors.

PORTABILITY
<<fputc>> is required by ANSI C.

DESCRIPTION
Objects of type <<FILE>> can have a ``position'' that records how much
of the file your program has already read.  Many of the <<stdio>> functions
depend on this position, and many change it as a side effect.

You can use <<fseek>>/<<fseeko>> to set the position for the file identified by
<[fp]>.  The value of <[offset]> determines the new position, in one
of three ways selected by the value of <[whence]> (defined as macros
in `<<stdio.h>>'):

<<SEEK_SET>>---<[offset]> is the absolute file position (an offset
from the beginning of the file) desired.  <[offset]> must be positive.

<<SEEK_CUR>>---<[offset]> is relative to the current file position.
<[offset]> can meaningfully be either positive or negative.

<<SEEK_END>>---<[offset]> is relative to the current end of file.
<[offset]> can meaningfully be either positive (to increase the size
of the file) or negative.

See <<ftell>>/<<ftello>> to determine the current file position.

RETURNS
<<fseek>>/<<fseeko>> return <<0>> when successful.  On failure, the
result is <<EOF>>.  The reason for failure is indicated in <<errno>>:
either <<ESPIPE>> (the stream identified by <[fp]> doesn't support
repositioning) or <<EINVAL>> (invalid file position).

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fseek>>.

<<fseeko>> is defined by the Single Unix specification.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

DESCRIPTION
Objects of type <<FILE>> can have a ``position'' that records how much
of the file your program has already read.  Many of the <<stdio>> functions
depend on this position, and many change it as a side effect.

The result of <<ftell>>/<<ftello>> is the current position for a file
identified by <[fp]>.  If you record this result, you can later
use it with <<fseek>>/<<fseeko>> to return the file to this
position.  The difference between <<ftell>> and <<ftello>> is that
<<ftell>> returns <<long>> and <<ftello>> returns <<off_t>>.

In the current implementation, <<ftell>>/<<ftello>> simply uses a character
count to represent the file position; this is the same number that
would be recorded by <<fgetpos>>.

RETURNS
<<ftell>>/<<ftello>> return the file position, if possible.  If they cannot do
this, they return <<-1L>>.  Failure occurs on streams that do not support
positioning; the global <<errno>> indicates this condition with the
value <<ESPIPE>>.

PORTABILITY
<<ftell>> is required by the ANSI C standard, but the meaning of its
result (when successful) is not specified beyond requiring that it be
acceptable as an argument to <<fseek>>.  In particular, other
conforming C implementations may return a different result from
<<ftell>> than what <<fgetpos>> records.

<<ftello>> is defined by the Single Unix specification.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.

FUNCTION
<<setvbuf>>---specify file or stream buffering

INDEX
	setvbuf

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int setvbuf(FILE *<[fp]>, char *<[buf]>,
	            int <[mode]>, size_t <[size]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int setvbuf(<[fp]>, <[buf]>, <[mode]>, <[size]>)
	FILE *<[fp]>;
	char *<[buf]>;
	int <[mode]>;
	size_t <[size]>;

DESCRIPTION
Use <<setvbuf>> to specify what kind of buffering you want for the
file or stream identified by <[fp]>, by using one of the following
values (from <<stdio.h>>) as the <[mode]> argument:

o+
o _IONBF
Do not use a buffer: send output directly to the host system for the
file or stream identified by <[fp]>.

o _IOFBF
Use full output buffering: output will be passed on to the host system
only when the buffer is full, or when an input operation intervenes.

o _IOLBF
Use line buffering: pass on output to the host system at every
newline, as well as when the buffer is full, or when an input
operation intervenes.
o-

Use the <[size]> argument to specify how large a buffer you wish.  You
can supply the buffer itself, if you wish, by passing a pointer to a
suitable area of memory as <[buf]>.  Otherwise, you may pass <<NULL>>
as the <[buf]> argument, and <<setvbuf>> will allocate the buffer.

WARNINGS
You may only use <<setvbuf>> before performing any file operation other
than opening the file.

If you supply a non-null <[buf]>, you must ensure that the associated
storage continues to be available until you close the stream
identified by <[fp]>.

RETURNS
A <<0>> result indicates success, <<EOF>> failure (invalid <[mode]> or
<[size]> can cause failure).

PORTABILITY
Both ANSI C and the System V Interface Definition (Issue 2) require
<<setvbuf>>. However, they differ on the meaning of a <<NULL>> buffer
pointer: the SVID issue 2 specification says that a <<NULL>> buffer
pointer requests unbuffered output.  For maximum portability, avoid
<<NULL>> buffer pointers.

Both specifications describe the result on failure only as a
nonzero value.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.

FUNCTION
<<ungetc>>---push data back into a stream

INDEX
	ungetc
INDEX
	_ungetc_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int ungetc(int <[c]>, FILE *<[stream]>);

	int _ungetc_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>, int <[c]>, FILE *<[stream]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<ungetc>> is used to return bytes back to <[stream]> to be read again.
If <[c]> is EOF, the stream is unchanged.  Otherwise, the unsigned
char <[c]> is put back on the stream, and subsequent reads will see
the bytes pushed back in reverse order.  Pushed byes are lost if the
stream is repositioned, such as by <<fseek>>, <<fsetpos>>, or
<<rewind>>.

The underlying file is not changed, but it is possible to push back
something different than what was originally read.  Ungetting a
character will clear the end-of-stream marker, and decrement the file
position indicator.  Pushing back beyond the beginning of a file gives
unspecified behavior.

The alternate function <<_ungetc_r>> is a reentrant version.  The
extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

RETURNS
The character pushed back, or <<EOF>> on error.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<ungetc>>, but only requires a pushback buffer of one
byte; although this implementation can handle multiple bytes, not all
can.  Pushing back a signed char is a common application bug.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<sbrk>>.
