How to translate the help files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create the required sub-directory, for example "es" for Spanish translation.
   Note: "es" is ISO 639-1; use ISO 639-2 if 639-1 is inadequate for your
   language.

2. Change into the created sub-directory, e.g. "tcl/lang/es/".

3. Copy some required files into your sub-directory
      > cp ../en/Makefile .
      > cp ../en/Overview.txt .
      > cp ../en/Welcome.txt .
      > cp ../en/Whats-New.txt .
      > cp ../en/Development-Roadmap.txt .
   and do the translation (not the Makefile of course).

2. Copy the wanted .txt file from "../en/", for example
      > cp ../en/Clipbase.txt .
   and do your translation.
   Note that only the *.txt should be translated, not the *.html files!

3. Generate the .html file(s) with:
      > make

4. If you like to see the results in Scidb you have to distribute the files.
   Change back to the "tcl/" directory and type
      > make build-help
      > sudo make install-help

5. Add new files with the command
      > svn add tcl/help/es/NewFile.*
   (Note that "tcl/help/es/" is the sub-directory for Spanish!)
   You have to change to the root (installation) directory before invoking
   the svn command. This is a local change, it's not a commit to the
   repository.

6. Commit your changes into the repository. Change into the the root
   (installation) directory and type
        > svn commit -m "Any senseful log message" tcl/help/es/
   (Note that "tcl/help/es/" is the sub-directory for Spanish!)
   The svn manual advices that the log message given with -m shouldn't be
   empty. Please don't forget the directory argument (the latter argument).
