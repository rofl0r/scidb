How to translate the help files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create the required sub-directory, for example "es" for Spanish translation.
   Note: "es" is an ISO 639-1 code; use a ISO 639-2 code if 639-1 is inadequate
   for your language.

2. Change into the created sub-directory, e.g. "tcl/lang/es/".

3. Copy some required files into your sub-directory
      > cp ../en/Makefile .
      > cp ../en/Overview.txt .
      > cp ../en/Welcome.txt .
      > cp ../en/Whats-New.txt .
      > cp ../en/Development-Roadmap.txt .
   and do the translation (not the Makefile of course).

4. Copy the wanted .txt file from "../en/", for example
      > cp ../en/Clipbase.txt .
   and do your translation.
   Note that only the *.txt should be translated, not the *.html files!

5. Generate the .html file(s) with:
      > make

6. If you like to see the results in Scidb you have to distribute the files.
   Change back to the "tcl/" directory and type
      > make build-help
      > sudo make install-help

7. Add new files with the command
      > svn add NewFile.*
   in sub-directory tcl/lang/es/.
   This is a local change, it's not a commit to the repository.

8. Commit your changes to the repository. Change to the sub-directory
   tcl/lang/es/ and type
        > svn commit -m "Any senseful log message"
   The svn manual advices that the log message given with -m shouldn't be
   empty.
