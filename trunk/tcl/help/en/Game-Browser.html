<div class="title">
  <h1 class="title">Game Browser</h1>
</div>

<p>
The game browser will be opened with a game from a game list. The browser
is bound to this game list. If the game list is closed while the browser
is open, no more games can be loaded inside this browser.
</p>

<p>
The game brower displays games in a simple form, this means without
annotations and sub-variants. The browser is especially suitable
for displaying list of games.
</p>

<p>
The game header contains three buttons: the event and both player names.
While keeping the middle mouse button pressed on any button an information
box will be displayed. Clicking a player name is opening a player card.
</p>

<p>
If the color of the game header is changing from blue to red, this will
signal an intermediate change of the game in the database. The game can
be re-loaded to see the actual game (&#x21d2;
<a href="#ReloadGame">Reload game</a> inside
context-sensitive menu).
</p>

<p>
While the mouse is not hovering the move window, but still hovering the
dialog, the mouse wheel can be used to play moves forward and backward.
</p>

<p>
While keeping the middle mouse button pressed on a game move the
associated board position will be displayed. Holding <kbd class='key'>Shift</kbd>
during the click will show only the pawn structure.
</p>

<p>
The browser is providing the following context-sensitive menu:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><img src="images/game-browser-menu.png" alt="folder" /></li></ul>

<p>
<span class="menuitem">Load game into editor</span>
Load the actual game into the game editor. The actual game in game editor
will be replaced with this game, so far the editor isn't locked or the
game is modified. Otherwise a new pane for this game will be opened in
editor.
</p>

<p id="ReloadGame">
<span class="menuitem">Reload game</span>
Update the actual game by re-loading. This menu entry is active
only if the current game is differing from the game in database due
to an intermediate change. A red coloured game header (normally the
game header is blue) will signal that the current game is differing
from the game in database.
