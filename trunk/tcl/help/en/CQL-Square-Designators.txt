TITLE CQL - Square designators

<h2>Square designators</h2>

<p>
A square designator defines a set of squares.
</p>

<p>
An empty square designator denotes all 64 squares of the board. For example:
the piece designator <expr>&R;</expr> has an empty square designator. Hence,
this piece designator denotes a white rook anywhere on the board.
</p>

<p>
A simple square designator comprises two characters, the first of which is
a file, and the second a rank, in the usual chess notation. If the file
character is <expr>?</expr> then files a through h are designated. If the
rank character is <expr>?</expr> then ranks 1 through 8 are designated.
For example: the piece designator <expr>&b;b3</expr> has a simple square
designator denoting the square b3, and denotes a black bishop on b3.
</p>

<h2 id="compound">Compound square designators</h2>

<p>
A compound square designator can denote more than one square. One type of
compound square designator comprises a file designator followed by a rank
designator. A file designator comprises either the name of a file or the
names of two files separated by hyphens. A rank designator comprises either
the name of a rank or the name of two ranks separated by hyphens. A
three-character file designator denotes all the files inclusive between the
files designated by its first and last characters. A three-character rank
designator denotes all the ranks inclusive between the ranks designated by
its first and last characters. A compound square designator can also comprise
a sequence of square designators separated by commas. The set of squares so
represented is the union of the sets of squares represented by each of the
constituent square designators.
</p>

<p>
Any compound square designator not contained in brackets must be contained in brackets.

<h3>Examples of compound square designators</h3>

<table class="stripes">
  <tr valign="top" class="stripes">
    <td class="left"><expr>[a-c1]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes the three squares a1, b1, and c1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td class="left"><expr>[b3-5]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes the squares b3, b4, and b5.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top" class="stripes">
    <td class="left"><expr>[f-h6-8]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes the squares f6, f7, f8, g6, g7, g8, h6, h7, and h8.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td class="left"><expr>[a1,c4]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes the squares a1 and c4.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top" class="stripes">
    <td class="left"><expr>[a-h1-2,a8,h8]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes the first two ranks plus a8 and h8.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td class="left"><expr>[]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes no squares at all. This is very different from the empty
        square designator, which designates all squares.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Examples of piece designators</h3>

<table class="stripes">
  <tr valign="top" class="stripes">
    <td class="left"><expr>Ia1</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes a white minor piece on a1. It will match any position
        with a white bishop or white knight on a1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td class="left"><expr>&R;[a-h1-2]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">will match any position with a white rook on the first two ranks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top" class="stripes">
    <td class="left"><expr>[A&r;][a-h1-2,a8,h8]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">will match any position that has a white piece or a black rook on
        the first two ranks or the corners.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td class="left"><expr>[&R;&B;&N;&Q;&P;][a1,h1,a8,h8]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">will match any position with a white non-king piece at the corners.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top" class="stripes">
    <td class="left"><expr>&B;[]</expr></td>
    <td class="right">denotes a white bishop on an empty set of squares. This can never match
        any position of course.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
