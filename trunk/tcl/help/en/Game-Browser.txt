INDEX Browsing games
TITLE Game Browser

<p>
The game browser will be opened with a game from a game list. The browser
is bound to this game list. If the game list is closed while the browser
is open, no more games can be loaded inside this browser.
</p>

<p>
The game brower displays games in a simple form, this means without
annotations and sub-variants. The browser is especially suitable
for previewing a list of games.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#head">The game header</a></li>
  <li><a href="#data">The move window</a></li>
  <li><a href="#admin">Functions and settings</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="head">The game header</h2>

<p>
The game header contains three buttons: the event and both player names.
While keeping the middle mouse button pressed on any highlighted  button
an information box will be displayed. Clicking a highlighted player name
is opening a player card.
</p>

<p>
If the color of the game header is changing from blue to red, this will
signal an intermediate change of the game in the database. The game can
be re-loaded to see the actual game (<see/>
<a href="#ReloadGame">%::browser::mc::ReloadGame%</a> inside
context-sensitive menu), as long as the source database is still open.
</p>

<h2 id="data">The move window</h2>

<p>
While the mouse is not hovering the move window, but still hovering the
dialog, the mouse wheel can be used to play moves forward and backward.
Clicking on the cursor highlighted move will change the position to this
move.
</p>

<p>
While keeping the middle mouse button pressed on a game move the
associated board position will be displayed. Holding <key>Shift</key>
during the click will show only the pawn structure.
</p>

<h2 id="admin">Functions and settings</h2>

<p>
The browser is providing the following context-sensitive menu:
</p>

<dir><img src="images/game-browser-menu.png" /></dir>

<p>
<menuitem>%::browser::mc::LoadGame%</menuitem>
Load the actual game into the game editor. The actual game in game editor
will be replaced with this game, so far the editor isn't locked or the
game is modified. Otherwise a new pane for this game will be opened in
editor. This menu item is available as long as the source database is not
closed.
</p>

<p id="ReloadGame">
<menuitem>%::browser::mc::ReloadGame%</menuitem>
Update the actual game by re-loading. This menu entry is active
only if the current game is differing from the game in database due
to an intermediate change. A red coloured game header (normally the
game header is blue) will signal that the current game is differing
from the game in database. This menu item is not available as soon
as the source database is closed.
</p>

<p>

This menu item is not available as soon as the source database is
