INDEX Board Setup
TITLE Board Setup

<p>
This dialog provides the set-up of a start position. It is simple to
use, therefore only the features will be explained.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#PieceSelection">%::board::piece::mc::PieceSelection%</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Castling">%::setup::board::mc::Castling%</a></li>
  <li><a href="#StartPosition">%::setup::board::mc::StartPosition%</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Crazyhouse">%::mc::VariantName(Crazyhouse)%</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ThreeCheck">%::mc::VariantName(ThreeCheck)%</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="PieceSelection">%::board::piece::mc::PieceSelection%</h2>

<p>
If the mouse pointer hovers the board - in this case the cursor is showing
the selected piece - the middle mouse button will select the next piece,
and the right mouse button will switch the color of the piece. A square will
be emptied with setting the same piece on this square.
</p>

<h2 id="Castling">%::setup::board::mc::Castling%</h2>

<p>
In Chess 960 positions (or Shuffle Chess positions) the castling rook may not
be uniquely defined. In such cases it is obligatory to determine the file of
the castling rook. If the ambiguity of any castling rook is unresolved while
saving the position (with OK button), the application will detect this
automatically, and an error will be reported.
</p>

<h2 id="StartPosition">%::setup::board::mc::StartPosition%</h2>

<p>
Scidb is supporting Chess 960 positions. Chess 960 allows 960 different
start positions, which are enumerated with a worldwide accepted scheme,
developed from Reinhard Scharnagl. The standard start position has
number 518 in this scheme. With the input of a number the corresponding
position will be set-up. For further details of the enumeration see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960_numbering_scheme">
Chess960 numbering scheme</a>.
</p>

<p>
Scidb is alos supporting Shuffle Chess positions. Shuffle Chess contains
all the Chess 960 positions, with or without castling rights. Furthermore
Shuffle Chess is allowing positions where castling is not possible,
because the rule that the king is between two rooks will not be fullfilled.
These positions will be enumerated with an extension of the Scharnagl scheme
- there exists 2880 different start positions. All Chess 960 positions,
with or without castlings rights, are retaining their position numbers.
</p>

<p>
Moreover Scidb supports special start positions, provided on the FICS
server (as special chess variants). You can select a FICS start position
with button <img src="../images/fics-start-position-menu-button.png"/>.
But only the start positions which are supported from Scidb will be offered.
</p>

<h2 id="Crazyhouse">%::mc::VariantName(Crazyhouse)%</h2>

<p>
In this chess variant it is necessary to specify the pieces in holding.
</p>

<p>
Moreover a special button exists:
</p>

<dir><img src="images/set-start-board-marker.png" /></dir>

<p>
With the use of this symbol you can tag pieces which are the result of a
pawn promotion. This is essential, because in Crazyhouse promoted
but captured pawns are dropped as pawns.
</p>


<h2 id="ThreeCheck">%::mc::VariantName(ThreeCheck)%</h2>

<p>
In this chess variant the specification of given checks is required;
how often white has given check, and how often black.
</p>
