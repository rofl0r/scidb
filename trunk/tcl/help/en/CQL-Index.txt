INDEX CQL Introduction
INDEX Chess Query Language

TITLE Chess Query Language

<p>
Chess Query Language (CQL) was designed to allow researchers, authors, and
players to search for games, problems, and studies that match specific themes (<see/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160303173407/http://www.rbnn.com/cql/">CQL Manual</a>).
</p>

<p>
Scidb is using CQL-S 1.0, an extended set of CQL, as a basis for all search
functions. CQL-S is extended very comprehensive, to satisfy all demands of
modern chess databases. <nobr>CQL-S</nobr> is a backwards-compatible
enhancement, any standard CQL script should also be applicable in Scidb.
</p>

<p>
Note that some parts of this manual are taken from

<h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>

<p>
All search functions in Scidb are based on <nobr>CQL-S</nobr>. For the formulation
of CQL queries the CQL editor is providing a comfortable, clear, and easy to use
graphical user interface. Knowledge of the technical descriptions of CQL are
not required in order to apply <nobr>CQL-S</nobr>. Also it is not necessary
to understand the script language, solely the encouraged users will deal with
CQL scripts. Merely the following quite short introductions are inevitable
for the understanding of CQL:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="CQL-Piece-Designators.html">Piece designators</a></li>
  <li><a href="CQL-Square-Designators.html">Square designators</a></li>
  <li><a href="CQL-Range-Specifiers.html">Range specifiers</a></li>
  <li><a href="CQL-Percentage-Specifiers.html">Percentage ranges</a></li>
  <li><a href="Pattern-Matching.html">Pattern-Matching</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
But also for less technical interested parties it is enlightening
to take at leat once a look into the documents
<a href="CQL-Match-List.html">The match list</a>,
<a href="CQL-Relation-List.html">The position list</a>, and
<a href="CQL-Examples.html">Examples</a>, in order to obtain
an overview about the power of <nobr>CQL-S</nobr>. Even the most complex
search queries are feasible.
</p>

<h2 id="technichal">Technical descriptions</h2>

<p>
The technical descriptions are the basis for a deeper understanding of
<nobr>CQL-S</nobr>. This is also the foundation for understanding,
and possibly writing, CQL scripts. Also for the design of complex
search queries a deeper understanding is essential.
</p>

<annotation>
The technichal description is not a precondition for the usage
of the search functions in Scidb.

<ul class="index">
  <li><a href="CQL-Technical-Description.html">Technical descriptions &ndash; Overview</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="file">CQL files</h2>

<p>
Scidb is writing <nobr>CQL-S</nobr> scripts with file suffix <expr>.cqls</expr>.
If a <nobr>CQL-S</nobr> script is compliant to standard CQL (which is often
the case) this script is exportable to a CQL file with suffix <expr>.cql</expr>.
Scidb is able to import any <expr>.cql</expr> script, written by a third-party
product.
</p>

For a more detailed description of the file format see
<a href="CQL-File-Format.html">File format</a>.
