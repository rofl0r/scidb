INDEX Transforms of piece designators (CQL)
TITLE CQL - Transforms of piece designators

<p>
Certain transforms are defined on piece designators.
</p>

<p>
A <b>diagonal flip transformation</b>, applied to a piece designator, reflects
each square in its square set about the main diagonal.
</p>

<p>
For example, the diagonal flip of <expr>&R;a8</expr> is <expr>&R;a1</expr>. The
diagonal flip of <expr>[Aa][a-h1-2,f6,h7]</expr> is
<expr>[Aa][a-b1-8,f6,g8]</expr>.
</p>

<p>
An <b>off-diagonal flip transformation</b> applied to a piece designator
reflects each square in its square set about the a8 to h1 diagonal.
</p>

<p>
For example, the off-diagonal flip of <expr>&R;a8</expr> is <expr>&R;a8</expr>.
The off-diagonal flip of <expr>[&P;&p;][a1-8]</expr>, denoting a pawn on the a
file, is <expr>[&P;&p;][a-h8]</expr>, denoting a pawn on the eight rank.
</p>

<p>
A <b>vertical flip transformation</b> applied to a piece designator reflects
each square in its square set about the vertical bisector of the board. For
example, the vertical flip of <expr>Uf6</expr>, denoting a piece on f6, is
<expr>Uc6</expr>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>horizontal flip transformation</b> applied to a piece designator
reflects each square in its square set about the horizontal bisector of
the board. For example, the horizontal flip of <expr>Uf6</expr> is
<expr>Uf3</expr>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>dihedral transformation</b> of a piece designator is either a flip
transformation or a rotation by 90 degrees of the chessboard followed by
a flip transformation or the identity transformation. There are 8 distinct
dihedral transformations of the board. For example, the results of
applying the 8 dihedral transformations to the piece designator
<expr>&Q;c2</expr> are the 8 piece designators <expr>&Q;c2</expr>,
<expr>&Q;b3</expr>, <expr>&Q;f2</expr>, <expr>&Q;g3</expr>, <expr>&Q;f7</expr>,
<expr>&Q;g6</expr>, <expr>&Q;b6</expr>, and <expr>&Q;c7</expr>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>unit right shift transformation</b>, applied to a piece designator,
shifts each square in its square set over to the right one square. If a
square is already at the right edge of the board, it is removed from the
square set. If a square is at the left edge of the board, it is also added
to the new square set.
</p>

<p>
For example, the unit right shift transformation of <expr>&Q;d4</expr> is
<expr>&Q;e4</expr>. The unit right shift transformation of <expr>&Q;[c2,h2]</expr>
is <expr>&Q;d2</expr>. The unit right shift transformation of
<expr>&Q;[a2,c2,h2]</expr> is <expr>&Q;[b2,d2]</expr>.
</p>

<p>
The definitions of <b>unit left shift</b> transformation, <b>unit up shift</b>
transformation and <b>unit down shift</b> transformation are similar to that
of unit right shift transformation, with of course the location of the
appropriate board edges altering mutatis mutandis.
</p>

<p>
A <b>right transformation</b> is a composition of zero or more unit right
transformations. For example, the right transformation comprising three
successive unit right transformations applied to <expr>&Q;a4</expr> is
<expr>&Q;[a4,b4,c4,d4]</expr>, since squares on the left edge of the board are
always included in the new set. The result of applying this right
transformation to <expr>&Q;d4</expr> is <expr>&Q;g4</expr>.
</p>

<p>
Similar definitions apply for <b>left transformation</b>, <b>up
transformation</b>, and <b>down transformation</b>.
</p>

A <b>horizontal shift transformation</b> is either a left or a right
transformation. A <b>vertical shift transformation</b> is either a down
or an up transformation.
</p>

<p>
A <b>shift transformation</b> is a transformation that can be written as
zero or more horizontal shift transformations followed by zero or more
vertical shift transformations. There is exactly one shift transformation
that sends a given square to another given square. One possible shift
transformation of <expr>&Q;[b3,c4]</expr> is <expr>&Q;[d4,e5]</expr>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>color flip transformation</b> of a piece designator switches the colors
of each piecetype in the piece set of the piece designator, and then applies
a horizontal flip to the piece designator. For example, the color flip
transformation applied to <expr>[&R;&b;&p;][a2,c2]</expr>, either a white rook,
a black bishop, or a black pawn on either c2 or a2, is
<expr>[&r;&B;&P;][a7,c7]</expr>.
</p>
