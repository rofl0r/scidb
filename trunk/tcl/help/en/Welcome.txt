TITLE Welcome to Scidb!

<p>
This is a preliminary version of Scidb for try-out and testing. The first
full version will be released after a sufficiently long test period. Please
consider when experimenting with Scidb:
</p>

<ol>
  <li class="space">
    This version contains a lot of debugging information and is accordingly
    slow in several places.
  </li>

<!--
  <li class="space">
    The support of Scid databases (.si3/.si4) is performed by a quite complex
    emulation which is not yet sufficiently tested.
	  <annotation>
    Therefore please do not edit your original Scid databases with this program.
    </annotation>
    Per default the Scid databases will be opened in read-only mode, which is
    of course uncritical.
  </li>
-->

  <li class="space">
    The current Scidb format (.sci) will be finished at latest with the first
    full version (i.e. it will reach version 1.0 later, the current version
    is 0.94). Nevertheless the current format is already fully usable, and there
    will be offered an upgrade capability.
  </li>

  <li class="space">
    The support of the ChessBase format (.cbh) is not yet finished. Currently
    this application cannot open Chess 960 games.
  </li>

  <li class="space">
    From time to time a newer test version will be released.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Have a lot of fun with Scidb, whose development has already taken nine years!
