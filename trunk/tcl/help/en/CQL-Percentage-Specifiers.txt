INDEX Percentage range specifiers (CQL)
TITLE CQL - Percentage range specifiers

<p>
Some keywords are expecting percentage range specifications.
A percentage range specification consists either of only one
percentage value, which must start with an comparative operator,
or with two percentage values, separated by whitespace (and
without comparative operators).
</p>

<p>
If a percentage range specification consists of only one value, this
value is denoting the range, otherwise both values will specify the
range, with a lower and an upper bound.
</p>

<p>
The percentage value is a positive integer between zero and 100
(inclusive). This value must be suffixed with a percentage symboi.
</p>

<p>
These are the permissible comparative operators:
</p>

<box>
<table>
  <tr><td><expr>&gt;</expr></td>  <td></td> <td>More than</td></tr>
  <tr><td><expr>&gt;=</expr></td> <td></td> <td>At least</td></tr>
  <tr><td><expr>&lt;</expr></td>  <td></td> <td>Less than</td></tr>
  <tr><td><expr>&lt;=</expr></td> <td></td> <td>At most</td></tr>
</table>
</box>

<h2>Beispiele</h2>

<p>
The following examples are percentage ranges for counting connected
pawns on the board.
</p>

<verb>
&gt;70%
</verb>

<p>
More than 70% of all pawns on the board are connected.
</p>

<verb>
&gt;=20%
</verb>

<p>
At least 20% of all pawns are connected.
</p>

<verb>
30% 70%
</verb>

<p>
Between 30 and 70% (both boundaries are inclusive) of all pawns on the
board are connected.
</p>
