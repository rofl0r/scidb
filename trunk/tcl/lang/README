How to translate the language files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is required that your Scidb version is up-to-date. For this you should build
Scidb from the repository. Please install package Subversion:

   apt-get install subversion   # (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)

Fetch the repository version:

    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/scidb/code/trunk scidb-code

The latter argument is the destination directory. Change into the destination
directory and build the project as usual:

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

To be up-to-date with the repository an update is required from time to time.
Change into your installation directory and do

   svn update
   make
   sudo make install

Please note:

   - Only the strings (content inside double quote delimiters) should be
     modified.

   - It is possible to add comments after a string in this way:

        ::menu::mc::LeaveFullscreen "Leave &pantalla completa" ;# ok?

     Note that the sequence ' ;#' after the double quote is mandatory (don't
     forget the space).

   - An ampersand is denoting the shortcut for this command. The letter
     following the ampersand is the keyboard letter of this shortcut. You have
     to ensure that a shortcut is unique (inside a menu, or inside a window),
     and memorable.

If you like to see the changes, go into sub-directory "tcl/" and do

   sudo make install-lang

You have two choices:

1. Edit the file "tcl/espanol.tcl" ("espanol" is only an example), and later
install this file with "sudo make install-lang".

2. Edit the file "/usr/local/share/scidb-beta/lang/espanol.tcl", in this way
you don't need to distribute the modification. Please note that editing the file
"/usr/local/share/scidb-beta/lang/espanol.tcl" requires super-user rights.

If your language does not yet exists in
"/usr/local/share/scidb-beta/lang/localization.tcl" (utf-8 encoded), just enter
a new language entry:

- "Language" is the local name of the language (not the English name).

- "Code" is nothing else than the ISO 639-1 code (see
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

- "Encoding" is the character set, "utf-8" is preferred, but "iso8859-1" is also
  okay. If you need a different character set, please choose one from:
  tis-620 ksc5601 macCentEuro macUkraine jis0201 euc-cn euc-jp iso8859-10 macThai
  iso2022-jp jis0208 macIceland iso2022 iso8859-13 iso8859-14 jis0212 iso8859-15
  iso8859-16 euc-kr macRomania iso2022-kr macTurkish macGreek macRoman iso8859-1
  iso8859-2 iso8859-3 macCroatian koi8-r iso8859-4 cp1250 iso8859-5 cp1251 iso8859-6
  macCyrillic cp1252 koi8-u iso8859-7 iso8859-8 cp1253 iso8859-9 cp1254 cp1255 cp1256
  cp1257 cp1258 macJapan shiftjis utf-8

- "Filename" is the name of the file in sub-directory "tcl", it should be the
  asciified local language name (only ASCII characters) in lowercase letters.

If you've finished, please send the translation file, I will do a merge into the
old translation file (a merge is required because I'm constantly changing the
translation files).
