How to translate the language files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is required that your Scidb version is up-to-date. For this you should build
Scidb from the repository. Please install package Subversion:

   apt-get install subversion   # (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)

Fetch the repository version:

    svn co https://scidb.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scidb scidb

The latter argument is the destination directory. Change into the destination
directory and build the project as usual:

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

To be up-to-date with the repository an update is required from time to time.
Change into your installation directory and do

   svn update
   make
   sudo make install

Please note:

   - Only the strings (content inside double quote delimiters) should be
     modified.

   - It is possible to add comments after a string in this way:

        ::menu::mc::LeaveFullscreen "Leave &pantalla completa" ;# ok?

     Note that the sequence ' ;#' after the double quote is mandatory (don't
     forget the space).

If you like to see the changes, go into sub-directory "tcl/" and do

   sudo make install-lang

I'm assuming that you will change "tcl/espanol.tcl" in your installation
directory, but another possibility is to change the file
"/usr/local/share/scidb-beta/lang/espanol.tcl", in this way you don't need
to distribute the modification. Please note that editing the file
"/usr/local/share/scidb-beta/lang/espanol.tcl" requires super-user rights.

Currently the translation file is encoded with character set UTF-8. An
appropriate editor might be "gedit". If you prefer another character set, for
example ISO8859-1, send me a message, I will change the encoding.

If you're ready, please send the translation file, I will do a merge into the
old translation file (a merge is required because I'm constantly changing the
translation files).
