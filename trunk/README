1: Introduction

 1.1: What is Scidb?

   Scidb (for "Scidb is Chess Information Data Base" is a free chess database
   application for Unix, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS operating systems.

 1.2: Copyright.

   Scidb is copyrighted software. It is freely distributable under the
   terms of the GPL, which is a common license used for free software.
   See the COPYING file for details.

 1.3: Installing Scidb (Unix).

   On Unix-ish operating systems (such as Linux, Solaris, BSD, etc) you
   should just be able to type "./configure" then "make" to compile the
   programs. The configure script tries to determine the appropriate
   Makefile settings for your computer. If it is not successful, you
   may need to edit the file "Makefile.in" before typing "make".

   Scidb can be compiled only with the GNU compiler collection. You have to
   install this compiler if gcc or g++ is missing. On Linux systems gcc and
   g++ should be always installed. The minimal required gcc/g++ version is
   3.4, but a higher version is recommended.

   The configure script can take optional parameters specifying settings.
   For example, you want the install directory to be your home directory
   just type

      ./configure --prefix=~

   To install just type

      make install

   You need Tcl/Tk (version 8.5 or higher) installed to run Scidb.
   With a Debian based distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) just type the following
   for the installation of Tcl/Tk:

      sudo apt-get install tk8.5

   Alternatively you can download it from the website:

      http://www.tcl/tk

   Tk should be compiled with Xft support. Some distributions do contain
   a library version without Xft support, although the support of Xft is
   default. In this case it is recommended to compile and install Tk by
   your own.
