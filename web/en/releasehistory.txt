    <b><font color="#8B0000">Specific problems on <acronym>Ubuntu</acronym>
    as of version 11.10</font></b>
    </p>

    <dir>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
        Instable <acronym>Tk</acronym> library 8.5.10 (which is well known as instable).
        It is highly recommended to install a stable <acronym>Tk</acronym> library
        (version 8.5.6, or 8.5.11, or 8.6.0).
      </li>
      <li>
        The pre-installed <acronym>Tk</acronym> library (all versions) is crippled,
        some windows will freeze (this means not responding to mouse or keyboard
        events).
      </li>
    </dir>

    <p>
    All <acronym>Ubuntu</acronym> editions as of version 11.10 are definitely broken
    &ndash; a result of the security pananoia of the Ubuntu team &ndash;
    and the developer has spent some weeks for work-arounds. It is possible that
    succeeding editions of <acronym>Ubuntu</acronym> will not be supported anymore.
    The <acronym>Ubuntu</acronym> team belives that any software is an attacker and
    is eliminating so called <i>security holes</i>. This leads to crippled
    and defect systems, not Unix conform anymore. But <acronym>Scidb</acronym> is
    quite ambitous and requires a fully operational Unix system. Moreover,
    <acronym>Scidb</acronym> is definitively not an attacker.
    </p>

    <p>
    There does not exist known work-arounds for these problems with the <acronym>Tk</acronym>
    library, except the installation of a home-made <acronym>Tk</acronym> library.

    Sub-processes are in general not working (for further details see

    crashes, in case no proposed solution (see link) is applied.
